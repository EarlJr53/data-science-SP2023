*Purpose*: Most datasets have at least a few variables. Part of our task
in analyzing a dataset is to understand trends as they vary across these
different variables. Unless we’re careful and thorough, we can easily
miss these patterns. In this challenge you’ll analyze a dataset with a
small number of categorical variables and try to find differences among
the groups.

*Reading*: (Optional) [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic.

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual

<!-- ------------------------- -->

```

*Background*: The RMS Titanic sank on its maiden voyage in 1912; about
67% of its passengers died.

# First Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Perform a glimpse of `df_titanic`. What variables are in this dataset?

``` r
## TASK: Perform a `glimpse` of df_titanic
glimpse(df_titanic)
```

    ## Rows: 32
    ## Columns: 5
    ## $ Class    <chr> "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1st", "2nd", "3rd", "Crew", "1s…
    ## $ Sex      <chr> "Male", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Female",…
    ## $ Age      <chr> "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child", "Child"…
    ## $ Survived <chr> "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "No", "…
    ## $ n        <dbl> 0, 0, 35, 0, 0, 0, 17, 0, 118, 154, 387, 670, 4, 13, 89, 3, 5…

**Observations**:

- Class \<chr\>
- Sex \<chr\>
- Age \<chr\>
- Survived \<chr\>
- n \<dbl\>

### **q2** Skim the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic) on the RMS Titanic, and look for a total count of souls aboard. Compare against the total computed below. Are there any differences? Are those differences large or small? What might account for those differences?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_titanic %>% summarize(total = sum(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   total
    ##   <dbl>
    ## 1  2201

**Observations**:

- According to the Wikipedia page, there were 2224 souls aboard the
  Titanic, versus the 2201 observations in the data-set.
- Are there any differences?
  - Yes, the number of people reported on Wikipedia is 23 greater than
    in the data-set.
- If yes, what might account for those differences?
  - Unidentified people
  - Last-minute cancellations
  - Passengers with aliases got double-counted

### **q3** Create a plot showing the count of persons who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class` and `Sex`. Document your observations below.

*Note*: There are many ways to do this.

``` r
## TASK: Visualize counts against `Class` and `Sex`
df_titanic %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  count(Class, Sex, wt = n) %>%
  ggplot() + geom_col(mapping = aes(x = Class, y = n, fill = Sex), position = "dodge")
```

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- In my process, I noticed that I had to spend some time figuring out
  how to combine the “child” and “adult” rows for each category, so that
  the plot would be complete.
- I also notice that the higher the class, the more surviving women, and
  the lower the class, the more surviving men (2nd class
  notwithstanding). I want to look at the data for all the souls on
  board to see if this is significant or just the breakdown of the
  passengers.

# Deeper Look

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Raw counts give us a sense of totals, but they are not as useful for
understanding differences between groups. This is because the
differences we see in counts could be due to either the relative size of
the group OR differences in outcomes for those groups. To make
comparisons between groups, we should also consider *proportions*.\[1\]

The following code computes proportions within each `Class, Sex, Age`
group.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit! We'll cover how to
## do this calculation in a later exercise.
df_prop <-
  df_titanic %>%
  group_by(Class, Sex, Age) %>%
  mutate(
    Total = sum(n),
    Prop = n / Total
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
df_prop
```

    ## # A tibble: 32 × 7
    ##    Class Sex    Age   Survived     n Total    Prop
    ##    <chr> <chr>  <chr> <chr>    <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>
    ##  1 1st   Male   Child No           0     5   0    
    ##  2 2nd   Male   Child No           0    11   0    
    ##  3 3rd   Male   Child No          35    48   0.729
    ##  4 Crew  Male   Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  5 1st   Female Child No           0     1   0    
    ##  6 2nd   Female Child No           0    13   0    
    ##  7 3rd   Female Child No          17    31   0.548
    ##  8 Crew  Female Child No           0     0 NaN    
    ##  9 1st   Male   Adult No         118   175   0.674
    ## 10 2nd   Male   Adult No         154   168   0.917
    ## # … with 22 more rows

### **q4** Replicate your visual from q3, but display `Prop` in place of `n`. Document your observations, and note any new/different observations you make in comparison with q3. Is there anything *fishy* in your plot?

``` r
df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot() + geom_col(mapping = aes(
    x = Class,
    y = Prop,
    fill = Sex
  ), position = "dodge")
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_col()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- I notice that 100% of the 1st and 2nd class passengers in this plot
  have survived., along with most of the female crew.
- Is there anything *fishy* going on in your plot?
  - At first glance, I notice that the 1st-3rd class numbers do not line
    up with what I would expect, especially the 100% survival rate in
    1st and 2nd class. This indicates that the plot is likely drawing
    both data-points on top of each other, with the bigger value masking
    the smaller value. This is because I did not combine the `n` values
    (and by extension `Prop` values) for the children and adults who
    otherwise would be the same category.

### **q5** Create a plot showing the group-proportion of occupants who *did* survive, along with aesthetics for `Class`, `Sex`, *and* `Age`. Document your observations below.

*Hint*: Don’t forget that you can use `facet_grid` to help consider
additional variables!

``` r
df_prop %>%
  filter(Survived == "Yes") %>%
  ggplot() +
    geom_col(mapping = aes(
      x = Class,
      y = Prop,
      fill = Sex
    ), position = "dodge") +
    facet_grid(. ~ Age)
```

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (`geom_col()`).

![](c01-titanic-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q5-task-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

- When showing the two age groups side by side, I notice that 100% of
  the children, and the vast majority of women, in 1st and 2nd class
  survived, while a very small percentage of the men survived.
- I notice, generally, that the higher the class, the more women
  survived.
- If you saw something *fishy* in q4 above, use your new plot to explain
  the fishy-ness.
  - In q4, I hadn’t represented *or* removed the `Age` attribute. Back
    in q3, I removed the age attribute by adding the `n` values for the
    corresponding child and adult entries. In q5, I added `Age` as an
    aesthetic, by splitting children and adults into a `facet_grid`.
    This allows me to see the data for children and adults separately,
    and also compare them to each other.

# Notes

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

\[1\] This is basically the same idea as [Dimensional
Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis); computing
proportions is akin to non-dimensionalizing a quantity.
