*Purpose*: Random sampling is extremely powerful. To build more
intuition for how we can use random sampling to solve problems, we’ll
tackle what—at first blush—doesn’t seem appropriate for a random
approach: estimating fundamental deterministic constants. In this
challenge you’ll work through an example of turning a deterministic
problem into a random sampling problem, and practice quantifying
uncertainty in your estimate.

*Background*: In 2014, some crazy Quebecois physicists estimated $\pi$
with a pump-action shotgun\[1,2\]. Their technique was based on the
*Monte Carlo method*, a general strategy for turning deterministic
problems into random sampling.

# Monte Carlo

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The [Monte Carlo
method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) is the use of
randomness to produce approximate answers to deterministic problems. Its
power lies in its simplicity: So long as we can take our deterministic
problem and express it in terms of random variables, we can use simple
random sampling to produce an approximate answer. Monte Carlo has an
[incredible
number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#Applications)
of applications; for instance Ken Perlin won an [Academy
Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) for developing a
particular flavor of Monte Carlo for generating artificial textures.

I remember when I first learned about Monte Carlo, I thought the whole
idea was pretty strange: If I have a deterministic problem, why wouldn’t
I just “do the math” and get the right answer? It turns out “doing the
math” is often hard—and in some cases an analytic solution is simply not
possible. Problems that are easy to do by hand can quickly become
intractable if you make a slight change to the problem formulation.
Monte Carlo is a *general* approach; so long as you can model your
problem in terms of random variables, you can apply the Monte Carlo
method. See Ref. \[3\] for many more details on using Monte Carlo.

In this challenge, we’ll tackle a deterministic problem (computing
$\pi$) with the Monte Carlo method.

## Theory

<!-- ------------------------- -->

The idea behind estimating $\pi$ via Monte Carlo is to set up a
probability estimation problem whose solution is related to $\pi$.
Consider the following sets: a square with side length one $St$, and a
quarter-circle $Sc$.

``` r
## NOTE: No need to edit; this visual helps explain the pi estimation scheme
tibble(x = seq(0, 1, length.out = 100)) %>%
  mutate(y = sqrt(1 - x^2)) %>%

  ggplot(aes(x, y)) +
  annotate(
    "rect",
    xmin = 0, ymin = 0, xmax = 1, ymax = 1,
    fill = "grey40",
    size = 1
  ) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = y), fill = "coral") +
  geom_line() +
  annotate(
    "label",
    x = 0.5, y = 0.5, label = "Sc",
    size = 8
  ) +
  annotate(
    "label",
    x = 0.8, y = 0.8, label = "St",
    size = 8
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1/2, 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1/2, 1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_fixed()
```

![](c07-monte-carlo-assignment_files/figure-gfm/vis-areas-1.png)<!-- -->

The area of the set $Sc$ is $\pi/4$, while the area of $St$ is $1$. Thus
the probability that a *uniform* random variable over the square lands
inside $Sc$ is the ratio of the areas, that is

$$\mathbb{P}_{X}[X \in Sc] = (\pi / 4) / 1 = \frac{\pi}{4}.$$

This expression is our ticket to estimating $\pi$ with a source of
randomness: If we estimate the probability above and multiply by $4$,
we’ll be estimating $\pi$.

## Implementation

<!-- ------------------------- -->

Remember in `e-stat02-probability` we learned how to estimate
probabilities as the limit of frequencies. Use your knowledge from that
exercise to generate Monte Carlo data.

### **q1** Pick a sample size $n$ and generate $n$ points *uniform randomly* in the square $x \in [0, 1]$ and $y \in [0, 1]$. Create a column `stat` whose mean will converge to $\pi$.

*Hint*: Remember that the mean of an *indicator function* on your target
set will estimate the probability of points landing in that area (see
`e-stat02-probability`). Based on the expression above, you’ll need to
*modify* that indicator to produce an estimate of $\pi$.

``` r
## TASK: Choose a sample size and generate samples
n <- 1000 # Choose a sample size
df_q1 <-
  tibble(
    x = runif(n = n, min = 0, max = 1),
    y = runif(n = n, min = 0, max = 1),
    stat = 4 * (0 + (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) < 1))
  )
```

### **q2** Using your data in `df_q1`, estimate $\pi$.

``` r
## TASK: Estimate pi using your data from q1
pi_est <- mean(df_q1$stat)
pi_est
```

# Quantifying Uncertainty

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

You now have an estimate of $\pi$, but how trustworthy is that estimate?
In `e-stat06-clt` we discussed *confidence intervals* as a means to
quantify the uncertainty in an estimate. Now you’ll apply that knowledge
to assess your $\pi$ estimate.

### **q3** Using a CLT approximation, produce a confidence interval for your estimate of $\pi$. Make sure you specify your confidence level. Does your interval include the true value of $\pi$? Was your chosen sample size sufficiently large so as to produce a trustworthy answer?

``` r
lo = mean(df_q1$stat) - qnorm(1 - (1 - 0.95) / 2) * sd(df_q1$stat) / sqrt(n)
hi = mean(df_q1$stat) + qnorm(1 - (1 - 0.95) / 2) * sd(df_q1$stat) / sqrt(n)

c(lo, hi)
```

    ## [1] 3.075684 3.276316

**Observations**:

- Does your interval include the true value of $\pi$?
  - Yes, my interval includes the true value of pi.
- What confidence level did you choose?
  - I chose a confidence level of 95%.
- Was your sample size $n$ large enough? Why do you say that?
  - I believe my sample size *n* = 1000 is a reasonable value, although
    my confidence interval could be much tighter and still include the
    actual value of pi. I had originally used a sample size of *n* =
    100, which made the confidence interval very large.
