Antibiotics
================

*Purpose*: Creating effective data visualizations is an *iterative*
process; very rarely will the first graph you make be the most
effective. The most effective thing you can do to be successful in this
iterative process is to *try multiple graphs* of the same data.

Furthermore, judging the effectiveness of a visual is completely
dependent on *the question you are trying to answer*. A visual that is
totally ineffective for one question may be perfect for answering a
different question.

In this challenge, you will practice *iterating* on data visualization,
and will anchor the *assessment* of your visuals using two different
questions.

*Note*: Please complete your initial visual design **alone**. Work on
both of your graphs alone, and save a version to your repo *before*
coming together with your team. This way you can all bring a diversity
of ideas to the table!

# Grading Rubric

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics
define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

*Background*: The data\[1\] we study in this challenge report the
[*minimum inhibitory
concentration*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_inhibitory_concentration)
(MIC) of three drugs for different bacteria. The smaller the MIC for a
given drug and bacteria pair, the more practical the drug is for
treating that particular bacteria. An MIC value of *at most* 0.1 is
considered necessary for treating human patients.

These data report MIC values for three antibiotics—penicillin,
streptomycin, and neomycin—on 16 bacteria. Bacteria are categorized into
a genus based on a number of features, including their resistance to
antibiotics.

# Visualization

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

### **q1** Prototype 5 visuals

To start, construct **5 qualitatively different visualizations of the
data** `df_antibiotics`. These **cannot** be simple variations on the
same graph; for instance, if two of your visuals could be made identical
by calling `coord_flip()`, then these are *not* qualitatively different.

For all five of the visuals, you must show information on *all 16
bacteria*. For the first two visuals, you must *show all variables*.

*Hint 1*: Try working quickly on this part; come up with a bunch of
ideas, and don’t fixate on any one idea for too long. You will have a
chance to refine later in this challenge.

*Hint 2*: The data `df_antibiotics` are in a *wide* format; it may be
helpful to `pivot_longer()` the data to make certain visuals easier to
construct.

#### Visual 1 (All variables)

In this visual you must show *all three* effectiveness values for *all
16 bacteria*. You must also show whether or not each bacterium is Gram
positive or negative.

``` r
# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
df_antibiotics %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("penicillin", "streptomycin", "neomycin"),
    names_to = "drug",
    values_to = "mic"
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill = gram)) +
  geom_col(aes(x = bacteria, y = mic)) +
  facet_grid(vars(drug), scales = "free") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans='log10')
```

![](c05-antibiotics-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q1.1-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Visual 2 (All variables)

In this visual you must show *all three* effectiveness values for *all
16 bacteria*. You must also show whether or not each bacterium is Gram
positive or negative.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

``` r
# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
df_antibiotics %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("penicillin", "streptomycin", "neomycin"),
    names_to = "drug",
    values_to = "mic"
  ) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(y = bacteria, x = mic, color = drug, shape = gram)) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans='log10') +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.1)
```

![](c05-antibiotics-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q1.2-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Visual 3 (Some variables)

In this visual you may show a *subset* of the variables (`penicillin`,
`streptomycin`, `neomycin`, `gram`), but you must still show *all 16
bacteria*.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

``` r
# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
df_antibiotics %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = neomycin, y = bacteria)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.1, xend = neomycin, y = bacteria, yend = bacteria)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = gram)) +
  scale_x_continuous(trans='log10')
```

![](c05-antibiotics-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q1.3-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Visual 4 (Some variables)

In this visual you may show a *subset* of the variables (`penicillin`,
`streptomycin`, `neomycin`, `gram`), but you must still show *all 16
bacteria*.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

``` r
# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
df_antibiotics %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_segment(aes(x = penicillin, xend = streptomycin, y = bacteria, yend = bacteria)) +
  geom_point(aes(x = penicillin, y = bacteria), color = "red") +
  geom_point(aes(x = streptomycin, y = bacteria), color = "blue") +
  scale_x_continuous(trans='log10') +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.1) +
  xlab("MIC")
```

![](c05-antibiotics-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q1.4-1.png)<!-- -->

#### Visual 5 (Some variables)

In this visual you may show a *subset* of the variables (`penicillin`,
`streptomycin`, `neomycin`, `gram`), but you must still show *all 16
bacteria*.

Note that your visual must be *qualitatively different* from *all* of
your other visuals.

``` r
# WRITE YOUR CODE HERE
df_antibiotics %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("penicillin", "streptomycin", "neomycin"),
    names_to = "drug",
    values_to = "mic"
  ) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_tile(aes(x = drug, y = bacteria, fill = mic)) +
  scale_fill_continuous(trans='log10')
```

### **q2** Assess your visuals

There are **two questions** below; use your five visuals to help answer
both Guiding Questions. Note that you must also identify which of your
five visuals were most helpful in answering the questions.

*Hint 1*: It’s possible that *none* of your visuals is effective in
answering the questions below. You may need to revise one or more of
your visuals to answer the questions below!

*Hint 2*: It’s **highly unlikely** that the same visual is the most
effective at helping answer both guiding questions. **Use this as an
opportunity to think about why this is.**

#### Guiding Question 1

> How do the three antibiotics vary in their effectiveness against
> bacteria of different genera and Gram stain?

*Observations*

- What is your response to the question above? - Penicillin seems to be
  much more effective against positive Gram stains than negative ones.
  Notably, it seems to be particularly effective against Staphylococcus
  and Streptococcus-type bacteria, having low MIC values against all
  bacteria of these genera. - Neomycin is effective against both
  positive and negative Gram stains, but is particularly effective
  against bacteria of the Staphylococcus genus. - Streptomycin is
  primarily effective against a few positive Gram stain bacteria, and is
  effective against Staphylococcus and Bacillus genera.
- Which of your visuals above (1 through 5) is **most effective** at
  helping to answer this question?
  - Visual 3 was quite useful for this prompt, but I did also reference
    Visual 1 because Visual 3 only included one of the 3 drugs.
- Why?
  - Visual 3 was an intuitive way to understand how each MIC value
    related to the 0.1 efficacy threshold, while also including the
    positive/negative as a visual indicator. If I had a version of
    Visual 3 for each of the drugs, I would be all set, but I had to
    reference back to Visuals 1 and 4 to make sure I had the information
    needed for the other 2 drugs.

#### Guiding Question 2

In 1974 *Diplococcus pneumoniae* was renamed *Streptococcus pneumoniae*,
and in 1984 *Streptococcus fecalis* was renamed *Enterococcus fecalis*
\[2\].

> Why was *Diplococcus pneumoniae* renamed *Streptococcus pneumoniae*?

*Observations*

- What is your response to the question above?
  - *Diplococcus pneumoniae* was renamed *Streptococcus pneumoniae*
    because it shows very similar responses to all 3 drugs when compared
    to *Streptococcus viridans* and *Streptococcus hemolyticus*. All 3
    bacteria are effectively treated with penicillin and not so much
    with the other 2 drugs.
- Which of your visuals above (1 through 5) is **most effective** at
  helping to answer this question?
  - Visual 2 was a good way for me to see all 3 drugs and draw
    conclusions between the different bacteria.
- Why?
  - Visual 2 allowed me to see all 3 drugs, but Visual 4 was what
    initially clued me into the answer to this question, seeing the
    similarity in length and position of the line. Visual 2 was the most
    useful because even when cluttered, I could essentially draw
    vertical lines through the points for these three bacteria strains.
