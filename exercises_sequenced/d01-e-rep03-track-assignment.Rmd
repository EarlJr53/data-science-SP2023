# Reproducibility: Tracking Changes with Git

*Purpose*: In this class you'll turn in all your work using GitHub. To do this, you'll need to be able to track and push changes in your repository.

*Reading*: Follow all the steps in [Tracking Changes](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/04-changes/index.html)

*Topics*: Staging, committing, pushing

## Configure RStudio to use git
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

This exercise introduces the *graphical* interface for git through RStudio. To
use this interface, you'll need to click `Tools -> Global Options -> Git/SVN`.
If *Git executable* shows (none), click *Browse* and selec tthe git executable
installed on your system.

- On Mac / Linux you can use `which git` from your command line
- On Windows `git.exe` is probably somewhere in `Program Files`

See [these
notes](https://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/ubc-r/session03_git.html) for
more info.

## Set Up Your Repository
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

## Add a readme
<!-- ------------------------- -->

Navigate to your repository (the one you made in `e-rep02-create`). If you don't yet have a file called `README.md`, create it. You can do this through RStudio with `File > New File > Markdown File`.

### __q1__ Edit your `README.md` with information about your repository. For instance, you could add your name and a short description.

## Commit changes
<!-- ------------------------- -->

Once you've updated your readme, you can click on the `Git` tab in RStudio to check changes in your repository.

This is an alternative to using Git with the terminal. We'll work through an entire workflow of *commiting* and *pushing* our work to your GitHub repository.

### __q2__ From RStudio, click the `Staged` button for `README.md`. Then click `Commit` to open the commit dialogue; add a commit message then click `Commit` to finish.

This will open a window confirming your commit; you can safely close this.

Once you've finished this, you've successfully tracked your changes *locally*. However, since your repository is linked to GitHub, you can also save your changes by *pushing* them to the remote server.

### __q3__ Click the `push` button (green upward arrow, highlighted below) to push your changes to GitHub. Check your repository in GitHub (on the internet); you should be able to see your changes to the readme text.

Now you have a backup copy of your work in GitHub, and you can easily share your work by sharing a link to your repository! This is how you will submit Challenges to Canvas: by sharing a link to your work.
